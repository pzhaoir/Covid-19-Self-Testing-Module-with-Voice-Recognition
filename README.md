# Covid-19-Self-Testing-Module-with-Voice-Recognition
Introduction
   
This project identifies the risk of infection by identifying breath, cough, and speaking sounds to quickly and accurately find the covid status of testers and detect potential asymptomatic infection risks. These functions can improve the detection capability of medical departments and improve the ability to detect asymptomatic cases, thus effectively summarizing the current epidemic situation and stabilizing the prevention process.
